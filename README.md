# AWS Serverless React App

A reference project to deploy a serverless, full-stack React app onto AWS with Terraform. Inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bro0uFVDrWY) YouTube tutorial by Code Engine

A to-do list app which allows users to create, and read to-do's from DynamoDB

## Pre-requisite

- Make sure you have installed [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli), [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html#cliv2-mac-prereq), [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and configured a `default` AWS CLI profile (see doc [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-profiles))

```bash
terraform -help # prints Terraform options
which aws # prints /usr/local/bin/aws
aws --version # prints aws-cli/2.0.36 Python/3.7.4 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/2.0.0
node --version # prints v14.17.0
aws configure # configure your AWS CLI profile
```

## Configuration

- Create a Github project, and generate a personal access token (see doc [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token))

- Create an [S3 bucket](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/s3.html) to store Terraform state. Populate bucket name in `01-main.tf`

- Populate `terraform.tfvars`:

```bash
default_region      = "<YOUR_AWS_DEFAULT_REGION>"
github_username     = "<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>"
github_project_name = "<YOUR_GITHUB_PROJECT_NAME>"
app_name            = "<GIVE_YOUR_APP_A_NAME!>"
environment         = "<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>"
```

## Local Github Setup

- Initialize an empty GitHub project on your local machine

- Point your local repo to your new GitHub project

- Add the codebase to local repo and push to your project in GitHub

```bash
rm -rf .git # remove the existing GitHub project history
git init # initialize an empty local GitHub project
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your github user id>/<your github repository name>.git
git config user.email "<your github user email address>"
git config user.name "<your github user name>"
git branch -M master # create a master branch for codepipeline
git add -a # add the codebase
git commit -M "something from nothing"
git push -u origin master
```

## Local Frontend Setup

- Download the necessary npm packages

- Build the react app

- Run and test the react app

```bash
npm run-script install
npm run-script build
npm run-script start
npm run-script test
```

## Deploy

```bash
cd deploy # change to deploy directory
terraform init # initialises Terraform
terraform apply # deploys AWS stack. See output for app url
terraform destroy # destroys AWS stack
```

- When prompted for `github_token`, provide the value and hit Return. Alternatively, create a [local environment variable](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/variables.html#environment-variables) named `TF_VAR_github_token`
